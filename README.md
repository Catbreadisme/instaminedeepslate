# Insta-mine Deepslate
![An image of a deepslate block from minecraft](https://minecraft.wiki/images/Deepslate.png?7b6d7)
Simple Minecraft server plugin written for my server that I share with friends.
This plugin allows users to mine deepslate instantly with a netherite pickaxe, haste II and efficiency V.

It will not be turned into a mod, although I will add more versions in the future.
